## React-React Pita -- Who are we?
We are a group of five female front-enders learning JavaScript and React together. This is our first project and we face it with hope and motivation. We have very different backgrounds and that makes us a very special team with diverse skills that we put together everytime we engage in a new challenge.

## Awesome Profile Cards -- What is this project about?
Here we present an interactive Single Page Application (SPA) that allows users to create a personalized visit card. There in the app you can insert profesional data and obtain a preview of the information.

For the development of the app the following technologies have been used:
    -HTML forms.
    -Advanced CSS with flex and grid.
    -Mediaqueries and mobile first design.
    -Event management.
    -Connection with server.
    -LocalStorage.
    -GitHub Pages publication.

Awesome Profile Cards moves in between two screens:
    -Landing page.
    -Application page.

And it works following the next steps:
    -It allows the user to chose the color pallete of the card.
    -It allows the user to fill the from with his/her personal data and automatically obtain a previsualization of the card. This preview looks exactly like the final result the user will get.
    -It allows the user to create an URL with with his/her card and share it through Twitter.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
